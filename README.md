- Problem 2: [Video Explanation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x38YrvCE_QFu-kzOxR5PwS1EMWq6inEJ/view?usp=sharing)
- Problem 3: [Video Explanation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GnaJYPzomksbLD9f2_FkNvmp_R8qdmK7/view?usp=sharing)

## Approach
- Problem 1: Implemented using user input, list manipulation, and basic statistics (max, min, sum, average).
The program converts user input into a list, calculates highest, lowest, and average steps, and sorts the list in descending order.

- Problem 2: The program processes a list of book records and converts it into a dictionary to track the number of borrowing days for each book.
It then calculates the most and least borrowed books, average borrowing days, unique book titles, and sorts the books based on borrowing days in descending order.

- Problem 3:Implemented a word scramble game using random selection and string manipulation.
The program randomly selects a word, scrambles it, and allows the user 5 attempts to guess the original word, providing feedback based on the guess.
